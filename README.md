# Block 13, Javascript Functions, Workshop: Temperature Converter
 An JavaScript application to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. This page will prompt the user to enter a number, and we will convert it from Fahrenheit to Celsius and let the user know if the temperature is hot or cold.

# Instructions
Create a new project called "temperature-converter"
Prompt the user to input a Fahrenheit temperature and let them know that we'll convert it to Celsius
Create a function called convertToCelsius that takes in the user input (Fahrenheit temperature) and returns the Celsius temperature
You can use the following calculation to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius... celsiusTemp = (fahrenheitTemp - 32) * (5/9)
Create a function called describeTemperature which will take in a Fahrenheit temperature and return a description based on the following...
 Temperature     ->     Description
      < 32              ->      "very cold"
      < 64              ->          "cold"        
      < 86              ->         "warm"     
     < 100             ->           "hot"       
    >= 100            ->        "very hot"  

5. Send an alert to the user including the Fahrenheit temperature they entered, what that temperature is when it is converted to Celsius, and how that feels.
6. Push the project to Github and submit
